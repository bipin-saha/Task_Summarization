Several observations have made prior to this final decision but the applicant has paid no heed to the following requirements 1. It was stated in the earlier observation that any amendment in the registration required decision of the Board of Directors. In the first attempt an incomplete board resolution was submitted. In the second spell another board resolution was submitted where no decision on inclusion of machinery was recorded. It was found from the plain reading of the board resolution that the board decided to amend the equity not on the inclusion of machinery. This application sought inclusion of machinery in the amended registration. 2. It was stated in the previous observation that the applicant was not authorized to submit the application at least no proof of authorization was produced. The authorization should be approved in the board meeting to do certain task on behalf of the company. The proof of authorization is required to protect the interest of the company so that no unauthorized or illegal individual can do anything against or beyond the interest of the company. It was not complied with. 3.The applicant was communicated by the desk officer in front of the Director BIDA to understand the desired amendment and to know the actual country of origin. He was found answering in such a manner that he knew nothing about the application. Moreover in the first attempt he wrote China to be the country of origin in the second attempt he wrote Virgin Island British to be the country of origin and in the third attempt he wrote the United Kingdom to be the country of origin. All these were done without the knowledge of the Board of Directors. Those activities pushed this office to put the applicant on doubt as to his genuineness. Therefore finally it was decided to reject the application. However the company may submit application for amendment at any time with proper document. Machinery price does not match with Sl 6 Please hire a Head of HR from locally.Hence the application has been rejected The deadline for the application is 26 September 2023.
