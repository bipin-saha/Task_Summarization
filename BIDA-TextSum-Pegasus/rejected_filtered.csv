Please hire any local company in the post bangladesh has adequate SAP expert. the position is IT related. Please hire from local sources. The salary has to be more than the previous work permit (whose salary was 5/6 years ago).  The explanation is not acceptable. Several observations have made prior to this final decision but the applicant has paid no heed to the following requirements:\
\
1. It was stated in the earlier observation that any amendment in the registration required decision of the Board of Directors. In the first attempt an incomplete board resolution was submitted. In the second spell another board resolution was submitted where no decision on inclusion of machinery was recorded. It was found from the plain reading of the board resolution that the board decided to amend the equity, not on the inclusion of machinery. This application sought inclusion of machinery in the amended registration.\
\
2. It was stated in the previous observation that the applicant was not authorized to submit the application, at least no proof of authorization was produced. The authorization should be approved in the board meeting to do certain task on behalf of the company. The proof of authorization is required to protect the interest of the company so that no unauthorized or illegal individual can do anything against or beyond the interest of the company. It was not complied with.\
\
3.The applicant was communicated by the desk officer in front of the Director, BIDA to understand the desired amendment and to know the actual country of origin. He was found answering in such a manner that he knew nothing about the application. Moreover, in the first attempt he wrote China to be the country of origin, in the second attempt he wrote Virgin Island, British to be the country of origin, and in the third attempt he wrote the United Kingdom to be the country of origin. All these were done without the knowledge of the Board of Directors. Those activities pushed this office to put the applicant on doubt as to his genuineness. \
\
Therefore, finally it was decided to reject the application. However, the company may submit application for amendment at any time with proper document.         ,,,/- (        )           -    (            )        Machinery price does not match with Sl 6 Please hire a Head of HR from locally.Hence the application has been rejected The deadline for the application is 26 September 2023.

"Please submit the latest audit report, and documents relating to the submission of application for the post by Mr Yao Shangbing \
The copy of declaration should be changed because it seems to be edited.  As per the uploaded work permit, MR U SEIN LWIN working in the company since 1993 (doc 7). But according to the latest from XII, he is not an investor in the company. Hence the application for the extension of the work permit has been canceled. Please replace the post with a local employee please discuss with BIDA with relevant papers I have gone through the application of amendment, attached documents and board resolution. It is resolved that the price of products has been shown in the original registration a price per kg instead of price per MT. This explanation has no ground to accept. One example is sufficient to reject the ground. Price shown against garlic pickle is 8189 USD which is equivalent to almost 900,790. The question is whether this price is per kg or per ton. This price have no reason to believe for the price of per kg. It is astonishing how the company tried to mislead this office. \
However, No shortfall is required as the application is submitted for an impracticable amendment. Therefore, we decided to reject the application straightforward. After the previous shortfall, they uploaded docs 12 &13 and resubmit the application. Kindly see docs 12 & 13 and give your kind decision Earlier the expatriate illegally worked in Bangladesh beyond the work permit in the same company. Please hire local employees.

"Previously Mr. Prasanna Rangapriya Costa Kondan Kostalage worked as Deputy General Manager. Now he has been selected to work as manager which is lower rank than his previous job. Again, his salary is low in relation to previous job. The applicant of the ""MOHARA ASIAN APPARELS LIMITED"" has been suggested to give new job circular mentioning at least recruitment of DGM. But the applicant is reluctant to follow the request and hence he has submitted the faulty application. This application can be rejected. The job advertisement was for the position of QUALITY TECHNICIAN. Here selected person worked as manager. The person who worked as manager can't worked as technician. Hence, the application of E Type Visa for Mr. Anura De Silva Kiriella Gurunnanselage for the position of QUALITY TECHNICIAN may be rejected. a. the job advertisement was for the position of QUALITY TECHNICIAN. Here selected person worked as manager. The person who worked as manager can't worked as technician.

 a. According to the registration/amendment, information mentioned in section 2 is not correct.  \
b. ""List of machinery to be imported"" section is not correct. Head of product development team can't work as technician.  I perused the reply to the shortfalls. The shortfall-points were very clear to easily understand. The reply was not relevant at all to the shortfalls as remarks. The reply was too short as this seems to me that the applicant ignored the shortfalls. The shortfalls were clearly defined on specific issues, but the applicant had no scientific and logical answers to them rather he consciously avoided and skipped it. So I hereby, rejected the application for registration amendment shown major and unusual changes in annual production capacity and for other errors also.

The time elapsed is not sufficient to decide whether the company has/require extended capacity of production.
